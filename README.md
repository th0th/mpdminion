# MpdMinion

MpdMinion is a simple shell script I wrote for Music Player Daemon (MPD) to jump to song in library with the help of dmenu. It is result of my not being able to find a working script after a few hours of search and the idea that I gainer after using Arch Linux for a few years: "Do It Yourself".

## Requirements

* mpd (is it obvious right?)
* mpc
* dmenu

## License

I don't think it is reasonable to license four lines of code, no. Feel free to use, distribute, change.
